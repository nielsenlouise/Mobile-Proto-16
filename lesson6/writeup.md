### Some Questions about Design Intention

1. What does the logo/name communicate to the users?
   Facebook's logo is only a white f on a blue background: this is an implication that everyone should know what Facebook is, a kind of well-placed arrogance. The name shows the origin of the site/app, that it is a face book: it has the faces and names of many people generally publicly available.
2. Are all the features easily discoverable?
   I'm not sure I've even found all the features. I admittedly rarely use Facebook now, but 
3. In order to perform an action, how many times did you tap? Too many popups asking you to choose YES or NO?
4. How does the color scheme fit the overall feel?
5. How easy are certain buttons to tap? Are they used often?
