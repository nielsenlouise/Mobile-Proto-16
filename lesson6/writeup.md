### Some Questions about Design Intention
What does the logo/name communicate to the users?
  Facebook's logo is only a white f on a blue background: this is an implication that everyone should know what Facebook is, a kind of well-placed arrogance. The name shows the origin of the site/app, that it is a face book: it has the faces and names of many people generally publicly available.

In order to perform an action, how many times did you tap? Too many popups asking you to choose YES or NO?
  Facebook doesn't really have actions or purpose. Finding the posts for a specific group is difficult (swipe all the way right, scroll down a bit, then click). This is exacerbated by the existence of five screens to swipe between, which is just kind of terrible for me because I only use one of them and it's particularly far away.
