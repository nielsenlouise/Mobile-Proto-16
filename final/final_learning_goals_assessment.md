### I'm grading my learning goals

##### Learn to make decent UI
Learn how to make decent UI : we’d love to make an app without the Window 98 style default UI. In this project, we’ll try to make our app polished with a more aesthetically pleasing interface.

This was a team learning goal. For me especially, I intended this with a significant component of understanding how the xml portion of the project works. I believe I completed this goal decently well. I spent a lot of time on the xml files, including finding a style guide for xml code and implementing it as best I could. I also, especially in the beginning of the project, did a lot of taking the more functional interfaces and modifying them to be more user-friendly and eye-friendly. I think I should have done more user testing but I believe, even without that as a large component of our project, I contributed a lot to making an "aesthetically pleasing interface."

Grade: 28/30

##### Learn fragment interaction
Learn fragment interaction and how it works. I want to more active programming of the Java files and actually understand what I’m writing. The project is useful for this because it is kind of necessary for the app and if I contribute to it, I’ll learn it.

I definitely contributed actively to the Java files in this project. Fragment interaction still feels a little like a black box, but I am confident in my ability to implement and troubleshoot it. I built the navigation drawer with Margo, which involved implementing fragment transactions and even learning how to make a thing a link (which is much simpler). I nearly tried to make the navigation drawer toggle switch to a back button while in the fragment that edits your current task, but after understanding why that would be difficult--we put the previous fragment on the backstack no matter which one it is, and our settings fragment really should have been a PreferencesActivity instead--I made the design decision to not implement that. I believe that I achieved a reasonable level of understanding, although not as deep as I would like, because I can understand why something like that doesn't work and could implement something that does, given more time.

Grade: 25/30

##### Learn time management
Be better at time management, especially in the context of a project. I have long struggled with time management. I would like to be involved in setting (and meeting) realistic goals. The project is useful for this because an organized project works better.

I feel like I did this well. I think I did about a third or more of the project managing of Guilt Motivator and I think we scoped and managed the project very well as a team. We checked in before and after each sprint review to figure out what we had, what we need to do to reach MVP, and what makes sense to do in the next sprint.

Grade: 30/30

##### Overall
I definitely got a lot more out of this project than I put into my learning goals, ranging from things I probably should have put in my learning goals (like SQL) to things like
