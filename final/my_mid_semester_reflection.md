# Mid-Semester Reflection

### Progress
I feel like I've learned a lot in a fairly painful way. I'm comfortable struggling through writing an Android app and I know enough to know how and where to find help. I got here, however, through a lot of stress, mainly caused by a mismatching of the actual scoping of the assignment/lab and my understanding of the time commitment.

### Learning goals
- Learn/utilize/understand better coding practices: I feel like I'm better at git practices and commenting. I feel like I don't have the best practices but I don't really know what else to change/improve.
- Better understanding of how to make good/efficient code: I don't feel like I've gotten anywhere on this. Readable code, yes. Efficient? I have no idea what makes something efficient or how efficient my code is, I'm just glad when it works.
- Better understanding of how to design software-y things: I'm honestly not sure what this means. It's really vague. If it means the UI part of things, I feel like I'm getting there and having a lot of fun with the xml in these projects and most of my learning is ahead of me but not super difficult.
- Better understanding of how to design/structure a project effectively: I'm getting bits and pieces of this. An especially important part is scoping an achievable MVP and then giving space for adding cool features without feeling super pressured about completing everything. I think the final project will be relevant to this.
- Make something functional/cool: I think I've done that and I'm going to do that again with the final project. It's very exciting.

### Something I'm proud of
Lab 2 was fun and turned out pretty cool.

### Something I could have done better
Time management and figuring out how to give this class the time I need to get what I want out of it. This is probably my greatest regret for many of my classes. This is not an easy class and I could learn more and make cooler things if I gave the time.

### Teaching team, please
Office/NINJA hours are very good. Being approachable is good.

### Living up to expectations
I expected to have fun and learn a lot and be a little miserable, and I did all of those things. Making things work is difficult and requires learning things and success is fun and I might be putting myself together well enough that I'll be less miserable for the rest of the semester and that would be super cool.
