### Writing a Reflection

##### How do you feel about the progress you have made this semester?
I feel like I've learned a lot. Making an app seems possible. Consistently scoping team projects seems possible. Even learning new languages seems more possible. Overall, I'm pretty okay with that.

##### What progress have you made toward your learning goals at the beginning of the semester? Are those still your learning goals? If not, how have they changed?
I wanted to learn/utilize/understand better coding practices. I might have done this a little bit, but definitely not gotten any new knowledge in this area intentionally or consciously.

I wanted to have a better understanding of how to make good/efficient code. I don't think I really have this, still. I think my code is generally reasonably good Android practice and quite readable, but I have no understanding of how efficient it is or even where to begin learning that.

I wanted to have a better understanding of how to design software-y things. I think I have this; paper prototyping is useful and user testing is more important than I acted like it was.

I wanted to have a better understanding of how to design/structure a project effectively. I have this, I think. Guilt Motivator was pretty well scoped. Making something fun or something you care about and then scoping it down to very achievable is good. Work for MVP and then add features is a really good thing that I want to apply everywhere. Also, this project was much less stressful than the majority of projects I've worked on, which is good.

I wanted to make something functional and cool. I did that! With teammates. We made a ridiculous and fun thing that works and is pretty.

##### What is one or more things you are proud of this semester?
I'm proud of Guilt Motivator. It's ridiculous and it would be very unhealthy for me personally to use it, but it's fun and looks pretty good and works.

##### What is one or more things you wish you could have done better through Mobile Proto?
The labs, especially the first one. I feel like doing those well would not have necessarily resulted in me knowing more about making Android apps, but I would have been a better teammate, potentially able to contribute better to the final project, and definitely would have felt less bad.

##### What is one or more things the teaching team could have done better through Mobile Proto?
Those homework assignments in the first half, as a person who did not know Java at all, were brutal. Maybe scoping that a little more achievable would have been friendlier. Doing that next time would be wonderful. Also daily standups--those felt weird because my team never had one person who knew everything that had happened since last class, and honestly most of the work in a sprint is done during class or in the three days before the sprint review.

(I feel like the last two questions were covered in the other answers.)
